no need for the minimap in this version
only scroll to the component that just got edited from the diff
check in studio if there is something similar for scrolling to the change


find the id of the thing which changed from the changes
but the problem is
when you scroll to a specific part. there is a offset.
the offset seems to be equal to the total height of the code blocks found above the element
Another problem is that all the stuff in the rendered jsx have not got appropriate id given,
to them so it is hard to find
for example an anonymous-schema-3 will not be given this id in the UI
